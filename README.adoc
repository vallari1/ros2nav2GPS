#GPS FOR AUTONOMOUS BOTS(outdoor navigation)
## Localization without AMCL


1. empty map reqd.
2. make a new package in src before the CMakeList.txt
3. Make a package called my_tools.
4. make  a launch director in my_tools
5. new file: start_map_server.launch
6. code snippet: 
7. Disconnect AMCL. Retrieve the launch files
8. make robot launch file for gps :  navwithgps.launch.py
9. movebase.launch.py also ![[Pasted image 20231109022505.png]]
10. convert gps data to odometry data
11. make new file 
12. configure the robot_localization node for odometry, imu and gps in the yaml file
13.  Launch file ros2 launch my_tools efk_file.launch.py
14.  Give it a navigation goal with 2d pose goal in rviz

>git clone https://github.com/khanh93vn/beetle 

>colcon build --symlink-install  
>sudo apt  
>sudo apt install -y ros-humble-twist-mux ros-humble-navigation2

similar ackermman style robot with outdoor naviagtion
the navigation launch files is based on the steps given above

>ros2 launch beetle_navigation2 bringup.launch.py 



fix any bridging issues if they come up


>ros2 launch beetle_navigation2 localization.launch..py map:=/home/vallari/Development/beetle/beetle_navigation2/maps/map.yaml use_sim_time:=true

replace the location of ur map yaml file in local system
